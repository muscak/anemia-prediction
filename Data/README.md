# Anemia Dataset

*Anemia* or anaemia (British English) is a blood disorder in which the blood has a reduced ability to carry oxygen due to a lower than normal number of red blood cells, or a reduction in the amount of haemoglobin<sup>[1]</sup>.

Anemia dataset[1] containing attributes: 
- **Gender:** 0 is Male and 1 is Female
- **Hemoglobin:** Hemoglobin is the protein in your red blood cells that transports oxygen to the tissues of your body.
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC):** MCHC value found on a complete blood count (CBC) describing the average hemoglobin concentration in a given volume of red blood cells [2].
- **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** An MCV blood test measures the average size of your red blood cells [3].
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH):** MCH value refers to the average quantity of hemoglobin present in a single red blood cell [4].
- **Results:** 0 is Not Anemic and 1 is Anemic 

This dataset is used to predict if a patient is likely to suffer from anemia. Machine learning binary classifier algorithm to be used.
