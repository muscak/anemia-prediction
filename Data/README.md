- **Gender:** 0 is Male and 1 is Female
- **Hemoglobin:** Hemoglobin is the protein in your red blood cells that transports oxygen to the tissues of your body.
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC):** MCHC value found on a complete blood count (CBC) describing the average hemoglobin concentration in a given volume of red blood cells [2].
- **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** An MCV blood test measures the average size of your red blood cells [3].
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH):** MCH value refers to the average quantity of hemoglobin present in a single red blood cell [4].
and 1 label:
- **Results:** 0 is Not Anemic and 1 is Anemic 

As you can see in the below image that the dataset is fairly in balanced state.
